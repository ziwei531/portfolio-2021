        <p class="flow-text about-content">

            Currently, I am a student in Taylor’s University studying Computer Science. My goal is to one day enter the field of IT and work on projects that would further expose myself in the technologies used on the job. I am interested in working with data in the future, and I like building websites for fun occasionally when a sudden inspiration hits me. 

        </p>   

        <p class="flow-text about-content">
            My story of being interested in the IT field is not one of those generic ones you often hear such as “ever since young, I’ve always loved to play around with the computer” or “I enjoyed playing games therefore I’ve decided to give IT a go”. Rather, it all began when I literally enrolled into Foundation in Computing in Taylor’s College. To be honest, I had no idea what I wanted to study after graduating from high school, and I had no idea what my interest was at the time. When I chose to study foundation in computing, I was lowkey worried that I might have chosen the wrong pathway for myself, though my foundation classmates did told me that it was possible for me to choose another degree despite my foundation may be irrelevant to that particular degree. Luckily, I got to enjoy what I was learning, especially when I was introduced to Python and Web Development basics.  I enjoyed tackling the programming lessons that I was doing in Python, and I particularly loved creating mock websites right after I was done learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. During my semester break, I even took the time to create a Discord Bot using Node Js and a simple portfolio website to showcase the web programming assignments that I have completed. It was at that moment I knew I have grown fond of programming in general, and I have since taken the time to do extra online courses on Udemy and Coursera to further improve my knowledge in Web Development.
